## Who I Am

Hola! I'm Will, I'm a self-taught full stack developer with nearly six years of building things that solve real problems, and if I can automate it, I will. I got into this world out of curiosity, stayed for the problem-solving, and somewhere along the way it became both my craft and my obsession.

I'm a game dev at heart. I spend my off-hours inside Unreal Engine and Blender, shaping ideas into interactive worlds. It's where I get to build just for the joy of building. I'm a night owl, a perpetual learner, and forever a fan of The Lord of the Rings.

If you're into automations, learning new things about tech, or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out.
